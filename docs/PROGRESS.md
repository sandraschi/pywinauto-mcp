# PyWinAuto-MCP Project Progress

## Project Overview
PyWinAuto-MCP is a Model-Controller-Presenter (MCP) server that provides Windows UI automation capabilities through a standardized interface. The project aims to make it easier to automate Windows applications using the PyWinAuto library while providing a clean, well-documented API.

## Current Status (2025-08-09)
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Status**: In Development
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-09

## Completed Tasks

### Core Functionality
- [x] Implemented MCP stdio server in `main.py`
- [x] Set up FastMCP 2.10 integration
- [x] Implemented basic window management functions
  - [x] `find_window` - Locate windows by various criteria
  - [x] `click_element` - Click on UI elements
  - [x] `type_text` - Type text into windows or controls
- [x] Added health check endpoint

### Testing
- [x] Created test scripts for MCP tools
- [x] Implemented direct testing of MCP tools
- [x] Fixed issues with `find_window` timeout handling
- [x] Standardized response formats for all API endpoints

### Code Quality
- [x] Removed unused plugin system
- [x] Fixed packaging and installation issues
- [x] Added proper error handling and logging

## In Progress

### Testing & Verification
- [ ] Complete end-to-end testing of all MCP tools
- [ ] Add integration tests for the stdio server
- [ ] Implement REST API endpoint tests

### Documentation
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples
- [ ] Document known limitations and workarounds

## Next Steps

### Short-term Goals
1. Complete testing of all MCP tools
2. Document the API and usage examples
3. Add more window interaction functions (e.g., right-click, double-click)
4. Improve error messages and logging

### Medium-term Goals
1. Add support for more complex UI interactions
2. Implement window screenshot functionality
3. Add support for UI element inspection
4. Improve performance for complex automation tasks

## Known Issues
- [ ] `find_window` may have issues with certain window classes
- [ ] Some edge cases in window interaction functions need to be handled
- [ ] Limited error recovery in some scenarios
